# 📚 Student Register – Java CRUD with Dynamic Structures

This repository contains a Java-based CRUD application designed for managing student records. Developed as part of a study on dynamic structures in Java, this project explores various data storage techniques, including:

- 📋 Array-based lists
- 🧩 Dynamic vectors
- 🗃️ Custom storage interfaces

## 🛠 Features

- Register new students with name and personal information
- List and display all registered students
- Edit or remove student data
- Dynamic data management using:
  - `ListaArray.java`
  - `VetDin.java`
- Basic GUI interactions handled through:
  - `Cad_gui.java`
  - `App.java`

## 📁 Main Classes

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Aluno.java` | Defines student attributes |
| `CadastroAlunos.java` | Main logic for CRUD operations |
| `Cad_gui.java` | GUI interface for registration |
| `ListaArray.java` | Array-based storage |
| `VetDin.java` | Dynamic vector-based storage |
| `IArmazenador.java` | Interface for storage abstractions |
| `App.java` | Main runner class |

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run the project using **BlueJ** or any IDE that supports Java. The entry point is the `App.java` file. GUI interaction starts via `Cad_gui`.

## 📌 Notes

This project was developed for academic purposes as part of the **Data Structures in Java** curriculum. It emphasizes object-oriented design and polymorphism through interface-based storage.
